# üöó Uber Microservices Architecture

This repository serves as the central hub for the Uber Microservices Architecture project, designed to showcase a robust and scalable ride-sharing application. Each microservice is built using Spring Boot and handles a specific functionality of the application.

## üåü Project Highlights

- **Real-time Driver Location Tracking**: Utilizes Redis for efficient real-time location updates and proximity searches.
- **Booking Management**: Comprehensive handling of ride bookings, ensuring reliability and performance.
- **Interactive Communication**: Real-time interactions via STOMP-based WebSockets for seamless client and service communication.
- **Robust Authentication**: Secure JWT token-based authentication implemented with Spring Security.
- **User Reviews**: Complete CRUD operations for managing driver and passenger reviews.
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic service registration and discovery managed by Eureka.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Kafka for robust and scalable asynchronous communication.
  

## üõ†Ô∏è Microservice Breakdown
